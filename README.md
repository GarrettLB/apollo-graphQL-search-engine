# apollo-graphQL-search-engine

# Description
This book search engine was built to showcase GraphQl. I replaced an existing RESTful api with a custom GraphQl one, overhauling the entire database functionality.

### Key Features
* A jwt is generated when a user is created or logs in.
* If logged in, a user can save books to their collection.
* If logged in, a user has the option to see their saved books.
* All users and books added to their collection are saved to a MongoDB database.
* All typeDefs, resolvers, queries, and mutations designed completely from scratch!
* GraphQL!

# Technologies
* node.js
* express
* React
* GraphQL
* @apollo-server
* @apollo/client
* jwt
